kaos (2): Set up Golang workspace on my machine to use the ~/go/ GOPATH correctly, so I can just import from canonical, not relative, paths in go source (symlink from github repo dires to GOPATH)

sigil (2): Consider removing Ref as a persistent property, and instead having a hash function that hashes a Task struct to the same type of reference code
	hash code should depend on (Created, Project, Description). Altering any of these shoudl change the hashcode but altering other things should not.

sigil (2): Use cobra (https://github.com/spf13/cobra) as the CLI library for actual Sigil CLI, but with pkg/sigil containing all common web/cli/native app logic and the CLI code importing pkg/sigil

sigil (4): Date/time parsing should support natural language for "today", "tomorrow", and +n for n days from now; -n for n days prior, +-nw for weeks (7 days), and [month date] as in may 25

kaos (2): Add ability to specify the location for a kaosfile in an environment variable -- for usage as a general CLI for a non-project-specific project manager, like keeping the kaosfile in ~/Dropbox/
	Should make a kaosfile path resolution order and set a spec: local command line flag -> local ./kaosfile in cwd -> PATH
	Explicitly prohibit traversing up cwd directory parents to find a ./kaosfile -- might be useful when working inside a git project specifically? Otherwise not very useful and mostly bloat imo
